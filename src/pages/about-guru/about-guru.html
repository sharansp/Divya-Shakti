      (Guru is Brahma. Guru is Vishnu. Guru is Siva. Guru is the Supreme Brahman Itself. Prostration to that Guru.)
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      The Guru is God Himself manifesting in a personal form to guide the aspirant. Grace of God takes the form of Guru. To see the Guru is to see God. The Guru is united with God. He inspires devotion in others. His presence purifies all.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      A Guru is endowed with countless Siddhis. He possesses all divine Aisvarya, all the wealth of the Lord. He is an ocean of bliss, knowledge and mercy. He is the captain of your soul. He is the fountain of joy. He removes all your troubles, sorrows and
      obstacles.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      He shows you the right divine path. He tears your veil of ignorance. He makes you immortal and divine. He transmutes your lower, diabolical nature. He gives you the rope of knowledge and saves you when you are drowning in this ocean of Samsara. Do not
      consider him to be only a man. If you take him as a man, you are a beast. Worship your Guru and bow to him with reverence.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      A personal relationship with a living guru, revered as the embodiment of God, is essential in seeking moksha. The guru is the one who guides his or her disciple to become jivanmukta, the liberated soul able to achieve salvation in his or her lifetime.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      A guru also gives diksha initiation which is the spiritual awakening of the disciple by the grace of the guru. Diksha is also considered to be the procedure of bestowing the divine powers of a guru upon the disciple, through which the disciple progresses
      continuously along the path to divinity.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Indeed, if the devotee were presented with the guru and God, first he would pay respect to the guru, since the guru had been instrumental in leading him to God.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Saints and poets in India have expressed the following views about the relationship between Guru and God
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      &quot;Even if a thousand suns and moons rose, they would be unable to remove the darkness of ignorance within the heart. This can only be removed through the grace of the Guru.&quot;
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      “Guru and God both appear before me. To whom should I prostrate? I bow before Guru who introduced God to me.”
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      “It is my great fortune that I found Satguru, all my doubts are removed. I bow before Guru. Guru&#39;s glory is greater than God&#39;s.”
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      “Guru is Shiva without his three eyes, Vishnu without his four arms Brahma without his four heads. He is parama Shiva himself in human form”
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Hatha yoga, enshrines the figure of the guru as essential for liberation, and asserts that the disciple should give all his or her property and livestock to the guru upon diksha (initiation).
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      The Mundak Upanishad says that in order to realize the supreme godhead, one should surrender one&#39;s self before the guru.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      WHY NEED A GURU
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      You are in need of a Guru or Preceptor who will explain to you the right meaning, who will remove doubts and ambiguities, who will place before you the essence of the teachings.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Guru is God. A word from him is a word from God. He need not teach anything. Even his presence or company is elevating, inspiring and stirring. The very company itself is self-illumination. Living in his company is spiritual education.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      In your Guru, you have your human ideal of perfection. He is the pattern from which you wish to mould yourself. Your mind will readily be convinced that such a great soul is fit to be worshipped and revered.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Guru is the Moksha-Dvara. He is the gateway to the transcendental Truth-Consciousness. But, it is the aspirant that has to enter through it. The Guru is a help, but the actual task of practical Sadhana falls on the aspirant himself.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      A Guru is absolutely necessary for every aspirant in the spiritual path. It is only the Guru who will find out your defects. The nature of egoism is such that you will not be able to find out your own defects. Just as a man cannot see his back, so also
      he cannot see his own errors. He must live under a Guru for the eradication of his evil qualities and defects.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      All great ones had their teachers. All the sages, saints, prophets, world teachers, incarnations, great men have had their own Gurus, however great they might have been. Svetaketu learnt the nature of Truth from Uddalaka, Maitreyi from Yajnavalkya, Bhrigu
      from Varuna, Narada from Sanatkumara, Nachiketas from Yama, Indra from Prajapati; and several others humbly went to wise ones, observed strict Brahmacharya, practiced rigorous discipline, and learnt Brahma-Vidya from them.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Lord Krishna sat at the feet of His Guru Sandipani. Lord Rama had Guru Vasishtha who gave Him Upadesa. Lord Jesus sought John to be baptised by him on the banks of the river Jordan. Sant Shishunala Sharief had Guru called Govinda. Shree Basaveshwara had
      Sangameshwara the presiding deity of Sangama as his Guru. Allama Prabhu had Guheshwara(Animisayya) as his Guru.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Even Devas have Brihaspati as their Guru. Even the greatest among the divine beings sat at the feet of Guru Dakshinamurti.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Guru-Kripa, grace of the Guru, is very necessary. That does not mean that the disciple should sit idle. He must do rigid Purushartha, spiritual practices. The whole work must be done by the student. Nowadays, people want a drop of water from the Kamandalu
      of a Sannyasin and desire to enter into Samadhi immediately. They are not prepared to undergo any Sadhana for purification and Self-realisation. They want a magic pill to push them into Samadhi. If you have got such delusion, give it up immediately.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Guru and Sastras can show you the path and remove your doubts. Anubhava of Aparoksha kind or direct intuitive knowledge is left for your own experience. A hungry man will have to eat for himself. He who has a severe itching will have to scratch for himself.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      No doubt, Guru’s blessings can do everything. How can one have his blessings?
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      By pleasing the Guru. A Guru can be pleased with his disciple only if the latter carries out his spiritual instructions implicitly. Carefully follow, therefore, the instructions of the Guru. Act up to his instructions. Then only will you deserve his blessings,
      and then alone his blessings can do everything
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      A disciple is he who follows the instructions of the Guru to the letter and spirit, who propagates the teachings of the Guru to less evolved souls in the path till the end of his life.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      A true disciple is concerned only with the Divine Nature of the Guru. The Guru’s actions as man is not the disciple’s concern. He is totally oblivious of it. To him, the Guru is Guru even if he acts unconventionally. Always remember that the nature of
      a saint is unfathomable. Judge him not. Measure not his divine nature with the inadequate yardstick of your ignorance. Criticise not your Guru’s action which is done on universal vision.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      True discipleship opens the vision. It kindles the spiritual fire. It awakens the dormant faculties. It is most necessary in one’s journey along the spiritual path. Guru and disciple become one. Guru blesses, guides and inspires the disciple. He transmits,
      transforms and spiritualises him. The important eight limbs of the Guru-Bhakti are:
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      The real lasting aspiration to practise Guru-Bhakti ; Absolute faith in the thoughts, words and action of guru; Doing Sashtanga Namaskara with humility and repeating Guru’s name; Perfect obedience in carrying out Guru’s commands; Doing personal service
      to guru without expectation of fruits; Daily worshipping of the lotus-feet of guru with Bhava and devotion; Self-surrender or dedication of Thanu,Mana and Dhana in tha case of divine mission of Guru.
      <br /> Meditation on the holy feet of guru for obtaining his benign grace, and hearing his holy Upadesa and sincerely practicing it. Guru Purnima
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      What is Guru Purnima? The full moon day in the Hindu month of Ashad (July-August) is observed as the auspicious day of Guru Purnima, a day sacred to the memory of the great sage Vyasa. All Hindus are indebted to this ancient saint who edited the four
      Vedas, wrote the 18 Puranas, the Mahabharata and the Srimad Bhagavata. Vyasa even taught Dattatreya, who is regarded as the Guru of Gurus.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Significance of Guru Purnima
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      On this day, all spiritual aspirants and devotees worship Vyasa in honor of his divine personage and all disciples perform a &#39;puja&#39; of their respective spiritual preceptor or &#39;Gurudevs&#39;. It is a good time to begin your spiritual lessons.
      Traditionally, spiritual seekers commence to intensify their spiritual &#39;sadhana&#39; from this day.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      The period &#39;Chaturmas&#39; (&quot;four months&quot;) begins from this day. In the past, wandering spiritual masters and their disciples used to settle down at a place to study and discourse on the Brahma Sutras composed by Vyasa, and engage themselves
      in Vedantic discussions.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      How to Observe the Day
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      The Guru Purnima is celebrated every year on a grand scale. 1. All aspirants awake at Brahmamuhurta, at 4 o&#39;clock. They meditate on the Guru and chant his prayers. 2. Later in the day, the sacred worship of the Guru&#39;s Feet is performed. Of this
      worship it is said in the Guru Gita: Dhyaana moolam guror murtih; Pooja moolam guror padam; Mantra moolam guror vakyam; Moksha moolam guror kripa &quot;The Guru&#39;s form should be meditated upon; the feet of the Guru should be worshipped; his
      words are to be treated as a sacred Mantra; his Grace ensures final liberation&quot;. 3. Sadhus and Sannyasins are then worshipped and fed at noon. 4. There is continuous Satsang during which discourses are held on the glory of devotion to the Guru
      in particular, and on spiritual topics in general. 5. Deserving aspirants are initiated into the Holy Order of Sannyas, as this is a highly auspicious occasion. 6. Devout disciples fast and spend the whole day in prayer. They also take fresh resolves
      for spiritual progress.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      &quot;Wake up at Brahmamuhurta (at 4 a.m.) on this most holy day. Meditate on the lotus feet of your Guru. Mentally pray to him for his Grace, through which alone you can attain Self-realisation. Do vigorous Japa and meditate in the early morning hours.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      &quot;After bath, worship the lotus feet of your Guru, or his image or picture with flowers, fruits, incense and camphor. Fast or take only milk and fruits the whole day. In the afternoon, sit with other devotees of your Guru and discuss with them the
      glories and teachings of your Guru.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      &quot;Alternatively, you may observe the vow of silence and study the books or writings of your Guru, or mentally reflect upon his teachings. Take fresh resolves on this holy day, to tread the spiritual path in accordance with the precepts of your Guru.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      &quot;At night, assemble again with other devotees, and sing the Names of the Lord and the glories of your Guru. The best form of worship of the Guru is to follow his teachings, to shine as the very embodiment of his teachings, and to propagate his glory
      and his message.&quot;
