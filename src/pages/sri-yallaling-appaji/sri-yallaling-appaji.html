      Birth and childhood... Born to smt. Kashibai and Sri Shivappa, on July 13, 1885 at Miragi village, Sindagi Tq, Bijapur district. he was named Yallappa. His ancestors were of the Kuruba community (Hindu).
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:16px;">
      Early Childhood and Married Life - utter, dire poverty haunts Yallappa
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:16px;">
      He was a little boy full of fun and life. Nobody imagined what giddy heights, what tremendous depths lay hidden in the little body of this charming child.The child was supper natural. All its actions of infancy would indicate extra-ordinary happenings
      in the days to come and when the child was about six months old used to utter OM.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:16px;">
      Days rolled on Yallappa&#39;s daily routine was to take sheep&#39;s to yard, as per his family tradition. He also developed an expertise in malla yuddha commonly known as kusti, he was a great pailvan among pailvans(kusti patu). In the night would keep
      sitting in deep meditation for long hours.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:16px;">
      He increased the time for mediation and realized that God alone is one reality &amp; essence of life. His concentration increased greatly due to regular, pure meditation and unknowingly all siddhis (mystical powers) attended upon him at the tender age
      of ten years. No one could stop the fire of renunciation that was enveloping him completely.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:16px;">
      As Yallappa grew into youth his meditation and search for Truth intensified. Yallapa&#39;s growing detachment to the world and his passion for Pailvangiri worried his family and they decided to get him married.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:16px;">
      Yallapa&#39;s family got him married to Shivbhake Devi. He had little or no means to support his family and had to endure a life of utter, dire poverty.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:16px;">
      A description of the hardships faced by him will melt anybodyâ€™s heart. In the course time, Shivbhake devi conceived and not withstanding the labour pain she died (intra partum maternal death).
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:16px;">
      The grief stricken Yallappa wandered aimlessly until he came upon the saint Sri Sri Siddaling Appaji of Lachan.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:16px;">
      Entry into asceticism, Penance(Tapassya) and Diksha In DikshaGreat souls born with a mission, do not stick to a conditioning circle of bondage. True to this adage he left home once and for all, reached Lachan, where His Guru Sri Siddaling Appaji was busy
      in preaching to his disciples and Yallappa sensed that Guru is not pleased of himself, Appaji made Yallappa go through several hardships for several years &amp; then Yallappa sat under a tree(Areli) situated himself 3 feet above the ground level
      in air with his siddhis and performed penance tapassya for several years.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:16px;">
      By learning this Guru Sri Sri Siddalinga Maharaj took his disciples to the spot where Yallappa was doing penance and told all his disciples that he is my real shishya.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:16px;">

    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:16px;">
      Pujya Sri Sri Siddalinga Appaji tested Yallappa for the last time and told &quot;look Yallappa you will merged in Samadhi for three days, that is you will be buried alive in this grave for three days and this grave will be covered completely with mud,
      if you alive then will be given Upadesha(Guru kripa) are you ready for this hardship ?&quot;.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:16px;">
      Yallappa said &quot;Oh! Gurudeva I have no objection, I have no place to go than you, you are my destiny test me however you want as this body and soul is yours&quot;.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:16px;">
      After three days Appaji&#39;s disciples dug the grave where Yallappa was buried, The disciples were shocked by seeing Yallappa meditating and chanting &quot;OM SIDDALINGAYANAMHA&quot;. Then after seeing Yallappa&#39;s great yearning to attain the truth
      and his intense and resolute will against all odds, the great Guru hovered Purna Guru Kripa on him. Sri Siddaling Appaji blessed Yallappa with ultimate knowledge, thereafter Yallappa became Sanyasi.
