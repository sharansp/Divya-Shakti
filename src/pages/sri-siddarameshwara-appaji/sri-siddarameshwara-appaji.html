    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:18px;">
      Early Childhood and miracles
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:18px;">
      At the tender years of three and four, he use to rehearse the verses of Bhajan-Kirtan at home, what he has learned at various sacred places he visited along with his mother.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:18px;">
      The child became the pet of the entire village His playmates called him, Guru and he was called Brahmajnani, a &quot;Realized Soul&quot;, by the neighbors, as he comforted friends in distress and never seemed to get cross or tired.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:18px;">
      He never went to school properly, several times he told his mother that &quot;I know all these, and my school is completely different from these and there is no such school which I want to go.&quot;
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:18px;">
      When he was around 10 years old, he noticed that an eight year old boy about to die from poisonous snake bite. Sri balayogi Siddaram told grief stricken parents not to cry and apply prasada (Bhasma) to his forehead by remembering their family Deity, she
      did so, as told by balayogi the young boy woke up as though he was getting up from a sleep. The joy of the ecstatic parents knew no bounds.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:18px;">
      He increased the time for mediation and realized that God alone is one reality &amp; essence of life. His concentration increased greatly due to regular, pure meditation and unknowingly all siddhis (mystical powers) attended upon him at the tender age
      of ten years. No one could stop the fire of renunciation that was enveloping him completely.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:18px;">
      Entry into asceticism, Penance(Tapassya) and Peethadhipati of Achaleri Mutt:
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:18px;">
      A Guru from Jiddagee once came to Jambaga village and told Siddaram parents this boy is born to renounce the world, he convinced his parents and took Siddaram to Jiddagee mutt.

    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:18px;">
      Pujya Appaji&#39;s Daily routine was to go rounds for collecting biksha (alms), some people use to give and some others used to tease. A description of the hardships faced by him will melt anybodyâ€™s heart.There are some days he never went for collecting
      alms, and remained meditating without food and water for months. He was a great saint in the real sense, as he led a simple life without any worldly desires inspite of his exalted position at the prestigious Achaleri Mutt.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:18px;">
      Chosen Successor (Uttaradhikari) :
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:18px;">

    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:18px;">
      The stage beyond pride &amp; material attractions was reached. The final destination where the Jiva becomes one with Parmatman was reached. The blissful state where nothing can separate one from God was finally attained.

    <p style="color:#000000;font-size:18px;">
      Those who have had the great fortune of seeing both the Appaji together could have noticed the great reverence with which Sri Sri Shadakshari Shivayogi Siddarameshwara conducted himself in the presence of his Guru. Pujya Appaji used to visit Sri Sadguru
      Yallaling Appaji every morning, offer His prostrations at the most sacred lotus feet of His beloved Guru and only then commence the dayâ€™s work. Whenever Sri Sadguru Yallaling Appaji spoke to Sri Sri Shadakshari Shivayogi Siddarameshwara Appaji,
      the latter would reverentially bend forward and listen. Whenever They walked together, Sri Sri Shadakshari Shivayogi Siddarameshwar Appaji would never over-step his Guru. Whenever both of Them were to occupy their seats, Sri Sri Shadakshari Shivayogi
      Siddarameshwar Appaji would wait for Sri Sri Sadguru Yallaling Appaji to be seated first. Sometimes when Sri Sri Shadakshari Shivayogi Siddarameshwar Appaji arrived a little later than Sri Sri Sadguru Yallaling Appaji to attend a function, He would
      pay his respects to His Guru first and only then take his seat. Sri Sri Shadakshari Shivayogi Siddarameshwar Appaji would listen to Sri Sri Sadguru Yallaling Appaji&#39;s discourses intently.
